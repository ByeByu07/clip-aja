● I'll examine your API routes to understand the current structure and suggest how to add a new route for the post review feature.

● Based on your API routes and database schema, here's my suggestion for adding a Tinder-style post review feature for owners:

  Route Structure Suggestion

  New API Route: app/api/posts/review/route.ts

  This would handle:
  - GET - Fetch pending posts that need review (with pagination for the swipe experience)
  - PATCH - Update post status (approve/reject with rejection reason)

  How It Should Work

  1. API Endpoint Design

  GET /api/posts/review
  - Query parameters: ?contestId=xxx&limit=1 (fetch one post at a time for Tinder UX)
  - Filter posts by status: 'submitted' or 'reviewing'
  - Only fetch posts for contests owned by the authenticated user
  - Return post with contest details, user info, and TikTok video preview data

  PATCH /api/posts/review
  - Body: { postId, action: 'approve' | 'reject', rejectionReason?: string }
  - Update posts.status to either 'approved' or 'rejected'
  - Set posts.approvedAt if approved
  - Set posts.rejectionReason if rejected
  - Update posts.publishedAt if approved (or set to published status)

  2. Frontend Page Structure

  New Page: app/dashboard/owner/review-posts/page.tsx

  This page would:
  - Display one post at a time in a card format (like Tinder)
  - Show TikTok video embed or preview
  - Show clipper's name, contest name, view count, calculated payout
  - Have two buttons: ✓ Approve (swipe right) / ✗ Reject (swipe left)
  - Use gesture/swipe animations for better UX
  - Auto-load next post after action

  3. Database Changes Needed

  Currently in your schema, posts.status has these options:
  - 'submitted' - Just submitted by clipper
  - 'reviewing' - Owner is currently reviewing
  - 'approved' - Owner approved
  - 'rejected' - Owner rejected
  - 'published' - Live and visible
  - 'claimed' - Payment claimed

  You might want to adjust the flow based on whether you want:
  - Auto-publish on approve → Change status directly from 'submitted' → 'approved' → 'published'
  - Manual publish → Keep as 'approved' first, then owner publishes later

  4. Why This Structure Makes Sense

  1. Separation of concerns - Review logic is separate from regular post CRUD
  2. Owner-specific - Easy to add owner authentication checks
  3. Scalable - Can add filters (by contest, by date, by clipper)
  4. Tinder UX ready - Fetching one at a time optimizes for swipe interface
  5. Action tracking - Separate endpoint makes it easy to log review history

  5. Additional Features You Could Add

  - Bulk actions - Review multiple posts at once
  - Review history - Track who reviewed what and when
  - Auto-approval rules - Set criteria for auto-approval
  - Priority queue - Show posts from certain contests first
  - Filters - Filter by contest, date range, or clipper level

  Would you like me to proceed with implementing this structure?
