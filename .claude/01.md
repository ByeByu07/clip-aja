# Create post endpoint for clipper

i use better-auth to manage multiple account and the token management of tiktok account linking. 

first, fix the implementation tanstack form in components\contest-details-main-page.tsx, in that dialog user will select the account and add link tiktok content. after that post thta to api, to create a post, so now, the status of post is 'submitted', 'reviewing', 'approved', 'rejected', 'published', 'claimed', i dont have any reviewing layer right now,so skip that, directly 'published'. in the future the contest owner will make decision to reject or approve the post video of clipper.
